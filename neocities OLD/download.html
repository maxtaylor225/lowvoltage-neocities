            <h3>The landscape</h3>
            
                <p>
                    Streaming is convenient, relatively cheap (for now), easy on your hardware, and the primary distribution model 
                    favoured by online  retailers such as Spotify, Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, iTunes, and pretty much anything else 
                    you can care to note.
                </p>
                <p>(Pretty much.)</p>
                <p>
                    Streaming is a bit like renting something. You rent an unlimited pass to watch stuff on Netflix on a monthly basis.
                    You rent a pass to listen to unlimited music on Spotify, again on a monthly basis. You buy music on iTunes, but that's 
                    actually more like renting a couch--you pay full price for a couch you can take with you for three moves (can sign-in on 
                    three devices) and on the fourth move you buy the couch again. Repeat ad nauseam. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The problem with this renting is twofold:
                    first, you don't actually own these things (and in the iTunes example you only own them for a limited time. Good luck if 
                    you go through three separate computers in your lifetime, which you likely will) and as such you don't have any right 
                    to keep accessing them once you stop paying for them. Second, because you don't own this streamed/rented content then if 
                    the people who do actually own them--the vendors, the artists, the distributers, etc.--decide they don't want them up 
                    anymore they can just remove all access to them. Your favourite artist doesn't want their debut album up on Spotify? There goes 
                    that option, but there's bootlegs on YouTube. If you want to listen to that ad-free then that's a second subscription, unless you can 
                    bypass the ads. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that kinda negates the conveniency of streaming because everything has exclusive rights to different shows,
                    so to watch everything that's popular you need three or four subscriptions to separate streaming sites. Spotify has a monopoly 
                    on music streaming, but that's because it's the absolute worst. 
                    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZG0ksaO6w8">Here's some</a> 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDfNRWsMRsU">YouTube videos</a> on it if you're nasty.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if you pirate your shows? You know that the popular pirating sites move every few months to avoid 
                    takedowns, and leading up to these times they become slower and slower. Your adblocker picks up more and more hits. The
                    content degrades. Pirating is certainly a solution to the subscription model, but it's not ideal and is definitely only 
                    temporary. Besides, even with an adblocker it can be risky to visit these sites. (And if you're visiting a good site 
                    that's not supposed to host pirate media there's still the chance of it being taken down--and it's kind of your fault 
                    by the way. The more hits an inappropriate upload gets the more visible it becomes and the more likely it is to be taken 
                    down.) Cracked Spotify is still Spotify except it's free.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Streaming also kind of just sucks. More and more often you see people dissecting the bingeing model, which is bad for how 
                    TV is absorbed and it's especially bad for artists. As of writing, SAG-AFTRA is over 100 days deep into a strike and one of their 
                    concerns is how streaming sites like Netflix has basically removed the ability for writers to live on residuals. Its prevalence
                    of a model is convenient for most people, but if you, say, live in rural Australia with really bad Internet connection then 
                    the most streaming can do for you is 140-280p video with buffering every 15 seconds. Some of these are more important than others, 
                    but I mean to say that streaming isn't perfect even if you do like the rental model.
                </p>
                <div class="hr"></div>
                <h3>The devil</h3>
                <p>If you Google "data hoarding" what you get are a bunch of articles talking about the disorder--saving terabytes 
                    of "useless" data in the worry that it may one day otherwise go missing. Now, obviously I'm not rooting for you
                    to develop an anxious disorder that has you save every image on Pinterest that you come across. (Unless those images 
                    are really important.) But it's not useless and it's not automatically a symptom of a disorder to care about 
                    preservation in the digital space. Sure, if you're downloading gigabytes of baby names sites you may need to reconsider your 
                    priorities, (It's different when I download a bunch of Medieval names archives as html pages. Some of their links 
                    are dead already! Where else am I going to find fantasy character names!) but some things are important. A names site 
                    painstakingly curated by someone very devoted, I'd argue, is worth more than most baby names sites spewed out by AI to dominate 
                    search results. If that ever went down it would be a shame. Isn't that worth preserving?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's preserving data. It's also the way out of the streaming hellscape. If you download your TV shows then you 
                    aren't dependent on Hulu maintaining the rights to host it. If you save your favourite band's entire discography as FLACs or 
                    MP3s then if something gets blocked in your country or they walk back a release it's not lost. That's not even touching on the
                    (admittedly scant) possibility that a streaming service will fail and you'll lose access to all its files. Just remember that 
                    all those YouTube bootlegs, all those streaming files on pirating sites, exist because someone, at some point, downloaded the files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact is that downloading is preservation. The cloud is just space on someone else's hard drive, be it Google data centres or 
                    the disc of Steve, who has been faithfully maintaining his webpage on car parts since 2006. You can't be sure these hard drives 
                    will be accessible to you forever. You might as well make sure that what they have is accessible on yours. 
                </p>

        <div id="row-2">
            <h2>The Odyssey; or, It Might Be For You</h2>
            <h3>The cost</h3>
            <p>
                Not everyone has the time, space, or patience for data hoarding. It's not something that everyone would even take an interest in,
                although if you have a Neocities account you're more likely to be that type. It's sometimes tedious and from the outside it can 
                look pretty useless--kind of like making a personal webpage in the age of social media. Having an Instagram page is way more 
                conveninent than focussing on a Neocities page, but it isn't as rewarding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not everyone has the time or patience to download and sort files. 
                Not everyone has the <span style="font-style: italic;">space</span> for these files, which is why data hoarders care a 
                lot about their cloud storage or their external hard drives and their backups. (Personally, I'm struck with a wave of envy when 
                I see someone with a 10TB drive.) The good news is that space is relatively cheap. 
            </p>
            <h3>The benefits</h3>
            <p>
                With your own data collection you are the curator, the archivist, the audience, and the procurer. It's a personal library 
                like back when we all had DVD shelves or VHS collections. (You may not remember these times and get irritated when people get 
                misty-eyed talking about them. Bear with me.) Maybe you still have those collections, so you already know the benefits. 
                Obviously, it's accessible offline. What's available is only what you have, which means that you aren't going to be recommended 
                algorithmic muck. Whatever ads you have aren't live ads, and are instead more like bugs encased in amber. And, of course, you 
                own this collection. No one's going to come along at the end of the month and ask you to pay up or you lose your entire M*A*S*H 
                collection.
            </p>
            <p>
                So the benefits of a digital collection are <highlight>ownership</highlight>, in that you really do possess a copy of the file. 
                It's not something you're renting. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on where you're hosting it (I do recommend external hard drives over cloud storage, 
                but I'm biased) it's also <highlight>available offline</highlight>, and will be until you delete it--there's no expiration like there 
                are for Netflix or Spotify offline downloads. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's <highlight>adfree</highlight> and you're <highlight>not paying a subscription for it to be adfree</highlight>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's <highlight>preservation</highlight>--it's not uncommon for previously lost media to be found because someone at some point 
                downloaded it before it went offline. Maybe your copy of something could be the copy that saves it from being lost altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's <highlight>curated</highlight>; it's only what you've already decided you want saved, and nothing else. This means that it's not 
                based on a recommender algorithm, and that's what I think is one of the biggest draws of them all. Recommender algorithms tend to 
                classify people into categories, using similarity with other user categories to recommend you content. If you're a big fan of the Cure, 
                for example, you may also like the Smiths--although if you're familiar with those artists you would already see the flaws there. 
                (I'm bisexual and I'm not paying Morrissey anything when I listen to his music so I'm comfortable liking both, personally.) This means 
                that you're going to be recommended stuff that's already like what you're into, which disincentives discovery and privileges art that 
                is already popular. So...
            </p>
            <p>
                <highlight>You're more likely to discover new stuff you wouldn't have discovered otherwise</highlight>. Without an algorithm you're 
                going to have to take an interest in what you like to discover more, which means a couple of things. Maybe you'll use a few different 
                algorithms to recommend you music, like YouTube recommended videos and Bandcamp feeds. Maybe you'll use user-submitted recommendations,
                like <a href="https://albumoftheday.versary.town/">Album of the Day</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/">r/listentothis</a>. 
                Maybe if a friend already downloads stuff then you can make a copy of their files, and discover some new things in the process. Maybe you 
                find your way onto a site where you can upload files, and by scrolling through a user's profile discover
                some of their uploads that look interesting. Any which way you go, you're taking an active interest in discovery instead of relying on a 
                pigeon-holing algorithm, and that's better for diversifying your interests and for distributing eyes on media away from just the popular,
                recommendable artists. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <highlight>Your data can't be used for making money</highlight>. I don't just mean user data to advertisers, although that may be something 
                you care about. (I do, but some people don't.) I also mean things like Spotify playlists, which are probably one of the biggest draws to 
                Spotify. The playlist functionality is great for promoting Spotify as somewhere you can share and discover new playlists. With hoarded data 
                your listening and watching data is private--no more worrying about your Spotify Wrapped! You're free to listen to 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9tPWwCCU0s">Catboys</a> 500 times over!--
                and your playlists can't be used a draw for that site unless you really want them to be. 
                </p>
                <p>(I actually think YouTube is better for finding 
                really weird playlists, anyway. Try looking up Harry Potter RP playlists there. It's definitely not some corporated curated playlist, 
                and it may have some real gems. (Case in point: I discovered <a href="https://thejins.bandcamp.com/album/death-wish">the Jins</a>
                through, of all things, a 2023 The Batman Riddler playlist.))
            </p>
            <p>
                The <highlight>safety of your files relies on you and not a third-party</highlight>. Sure, if it all goes wrong then it's your fault, but 
                that also means you can make the efforts to prevent loss and to do it right.
            </p>
            <p>
                <highlight>It's satisfying and can be fun</highlight>. When you have your favourite music all downloaded there's a certain 
                peace that comes with that. It can also be fun to curate music like your own personal library of Alexandria, although, again, 
                that may come with a specific kind of person that enjoys making Neocities pages or entering data in spreadsheets. 
            </p>

            <h3>The how; or, Getting started</h3>
            <h4>I.</h4>
            <p>
                The first thing you're gonna want to do is negotiate <highlight>where you're going to save all this stuff</highlight> 
                and how you're going to make backups. (You're gonna make backups, right?) 
                Some people are very fond of cloud storage and backups. I see the utility of these things, but personally I wouldn't 
                ever go there. For a start, it removes your ability to secure your own data; it relies instead on the service provider. It also 
                means that it isn't accessible offline, which is fine if you have a good and consistent Internet connection. I don't. 
                What I'd really recommend are external hard drives. There are a lot of different kinds out there so you can research what 
                seems like the best choice for you. I have two Western Digital Elements drives, which work pretty well for me. The first one 
                is the one I use every day for listening to music, backing up documents, and watching TV. The second I only use once a month 
                for backing up the first one. You may want to use a combination of cloud and external hard drive storage, which is probably 
                sensible. <a href="https://www.datahoards.com/hard-drive-alternatives-the-complete-guide/">This article</a> covers some alternatives, 
                but don't be intimidated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You might then want to look at what you already have saved to your device. Images? Documents? A SasuNaru AMV that's been sitting 
                in your Downloads folder for eight months? Set up your storage bucket (hard drive, cloud account, whatever) into some folders for 
                chucking stuff in. You can always change it later. When I first got started not so long ago I had all my movies and TV shows in 
                the same folder, which slowed everything down from loading the list to actually locating stuff. Now I have a separate folder for TV
                shows and movies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current main hard drive folder organisation is the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>BACKUPS</li>
                    <li>Lectures</li>
                    <li>Friend's backup</li>
                    <li>Movies</li>
                    <li>Music</li>
                    <li>Podcasts</li>
                    <li>Programs</li>
                    <li>Text</li>
                    <li>TV</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can and probably will have a different organisational structure according to what you want to
                save and what you access most frequently.

                    <li>Open directories in general. Okay, I'm not sure how legal these are. They're probably not very. But they're still 
                        very interesting and are worth checking out (investigate some crawlers and search tools, or try formatting 
                        your own search! A good start might be Intitle:index.of "search terms" (file type|file type|mp3).). 
                        HUGE content warning for these--you never know what a directory might hold, 
                        and it's not uncommon for an OD to contain NSFW, and they might be a trojan horse for viruses. 
                        <highlight>Individual discretion is necessary.</highlight> But they can also yield some 
                        fascinating results, so it's worth investigating some if you're happy to give it a try.

                As for other stuff--it's easier than you would think to find some good sources. Scope out social media for some methods
                (Reddit is good for this because Reddit is good for everything, if you're a fed reading this then I'm talking about finding good 
                independent sites for purchasing content legally) and try some Googling. Check out if you have any friends that have some 
                copies of media to get you started. If you're already experienced in the pirating and cracked apps scenes then you probably 
                already have a good idea where to start.

                       <li><highlight>Don't share your links.</highlight> Loose lips sink sources, and if you post a link to a cool site or directory that's a sure-fire 
                        way to make sure it gets taken down. Share them among your friends if you're sure they're not gonna report it, but don't 
                        post it to social media! There are some places that are explicitly for posting links, but they have their own rules and 
                        are subject to frequent contingency plans. 
                       </li>
                       <li><highlight>Be considerate.</highlight> If someone's uploaded a bad copy of something then you can't get entitled about it. If it's 
                        an earnest mistake they may appreciate a heads-up, but definitely don't complain if it's in a language you don't speak.
                        Some people speak Spanish, you know.
                       </li>
                       <li><highlight>Use your common sense.</highlight> If you've been told you're getting an MKV file and what you're downloading is an EXE,
                        cancel your download! Likewise, scan your files before you open them. If you have a ZIP file then scan it too, and if you 
                        can check the contents before opening it. If you're on a sketchy site then be careful about downloading anything. If you 
                        can, check on Reddit or other trusted places about whether or not a site is trustworthy.
                       </li>
                       <li><highlight>Be careful.</highlight> Make sure you're running some kind of antivirus and that you download from 
                        credible or halfway credible sources. Your motto should be that any time you download a file you're risking being infected,
                        which is why you need to keep external backups of your files (in case of ransomware encryption) and that you don't have 
                        anything lying around that might be disastrous to have lost. If you download something your computer may be compromised.

                    <h3>How about getting money to artists specifically?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It's <highlight>highly important to pay artists</highlight> (if you can). Big TV 
                        show execs won't have much use for your money, but support TV and film writers and other creatives and 
                        where you can. For example, you should absolutely buy music legally--as long as it actually pays the artist, 
                        not their labels or a predatory hosting service. And if you can't at the moment, consider doing it in 
                        the future. If they don't have music where you can pay for it and download it, consider buying some merch 
                        or attending a concert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>And I do mean this sincerely!</strong> Support people who make stuff!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> is a fantastic site, although it may die 
                            soon. If you want to pay artists a living wage for their art then I highly recommend using Bandcamp to download some music. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As for TV and Movies--honestly, the best solution I've found so far is buying them on YouTube or iTunes or whatever is 
                            less evil, then pirating a downloadable copy. (You can screenrecord on YouTube but definitely not on iTunes, by the way.) 
                            Kind of makes you wish that streaming wasn't so popular so that there were more services where you could buy and 
                            download media legally! I spend quite a bit on Bandcamp and I would definitely pay to download legal 
                            copies of a bunch of shows (that isn't DRM protected--I want to be able to play these on VLC and to not 
                            risk losing access to them if the DRM-locker goes out of business).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your other option is to buy physical media such as discs and CDs and to rip them to digital files, which is completely legal 
                            (for personal use) and helps support artists.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some artists also have Patreons or KoFi accounts. If you're downloading something and they have this as an option, 
                            you should send them some money!

                        <li><highlight>Spend some time to organise your data.</highlight> Folders are your friend. Metadata is also incredibly useful,
                            especially for music files. VLC Media Player is good for entering metadata.
                        </li>
                        <li><highlight>MAKE BACKUPS!</highlight> Don't lose your data! Even if it's just to a second hard drive or cloud account,
                            make some time each month (or more or less frequently) to back up your recent changes to a second or third location. Don't be like

            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <p>
                <em>What about the sites that are losing money because you're not paying them anymore?</em> Fuck em. Subscription sites like Netflix 
                don't need my money and I hope they die. Ad-based sites should consider being less annoying. This is also a flawed 
                way of looking at things. Pirated copies of something aren't potential sales that have been lost because people may and often do 
                pirate things that they wouldn't pay for otherwise. Case in point, I acquired 15 seasons of Supernatural. It's a terrible show and 
                I'm enjoying it immensely, but under no circumstances would I pay real human
                money for it. Hell, they should be paying <em>me</em> for watching this.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Isn't this a bit paranoid? Streaming is just the way of the future.</em> It's a bad future. Besides, some people say that 
                cryptocurrency is the way of the future and even though it demonstrably isn't it would be a TERRIBLE future if it was. And I'm 
                not convinced that streaming is the way of the future. It's showing its cracks. At some point something is going to happen and it'll 
                lose its ubiquity, and when that happens I'm still going to be working my way through 15 seasons of Supernatural from the privacy of 
                my hard drive.

            <p>
                <em>You can't download everything you'd ever want. Why bother?</em> Well, I'm probably not going to be able to read every book in the world 
                that I'd ever want to before I die. That doesn't mean I should give up on reading. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Isn't it misguided to prioritise digital media so much when physical media has the same benefits?</em> Correct! That's why I staunchly
                support people who collect physical media too. I prefer reading physical books and comics myself, and I've started on a CD collection.
