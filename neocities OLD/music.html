            I've become interested in recording and talking some about music, since I've also become interested in expanding my 
            knowledge and listening habits. I don't know how faithful I will be to updating this, but it might be fun.

            RYM top 100 albums listen-through. To be a music snob you must listen to all these albums (I guess). 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    To Pimp a Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar. obviously it's great. i wouldnt rate it my favourite album of all time or anything but it's a great album. this is like asking if rocks in a river are wet
                </li>
                <li>OK Computer - Radiohead. listened to this one all the way through multiple times before. üëç no surprises here</li>
                <li>Wish You Were Here - Pink Floyd. i've never heard of this one before. prog rock really isn't my thing so i don't really get this one. it's fine i guess. maybe it'll grow on me</li>
                <li>In Rainbows - Radiohead. (rym lists the single disk version but i listened to the two-disk version.) heard this one before but wasn't paying attention so it was good to listen again. owns. i love it when yorke moans like a wounded dog and i mean this sincerely. </li>
                <li>Madvillainy - Madvillain. i've never heard of this act before and i've never listened to MF DOOM. however i absolutely get why this is rated so high because it's fantastic. if anything should be ranked higher and this proves that i need to follow more hip hop/rap discussions</li>
                <li>In the Court of the Crimson King - King Crimson. YOU. YOU DID THIS (MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FILTER BY "ROCK" AND NOT END UP WITH 17 MINUTE EPICS). i get why it's here (influence, probably sounds awesome to progheads) but with the exception of the final track i'm not a fan</li>
                <li>Kid A - Radiohead. </li>
            </ul>
